# Jon: Stuffing your face as usual

Garfielf: I gotta have a good meal.

Jon: Garfield, you fat cat! You are so big and fat! Why are you so fat?!

Garfielf: I eat, Jon.. It's what I do. It's time to kick Odie off the table. (he looks at Odie with a malicious intent)

Jon: Dont do it, Garfielf! That's our pet dog Odie!

Garfielf: You're going into orbit, you stupid mutt!

(Odie is kicked into "orbit")

Jon: GAAAAAAARRRFIIIELD!!!

Garfielf: Time for a nap. I'm a cat who loves to snooze.

Jon: GARFIELD YOU LAZY CAT! (his voice echoes across the room)

Garfielf: I hate alram clocks. (he smashes an "alram clock" next to his bed with his fist) I'm am hungry, I want some lasaga. (a thought bubble with lasaga inside hovers next to him)

Jon: You're eating us out of house and home, Garmfield!

Garfielf: Enough with the Chit Chat, lets get some grub going!

(grub time...)

Jon: Where are the three-cheese pizzas?

Garfielf: I ate those food.

Jon: Where are the taco shells?

Garfielf: I ate those food.

Jon: Where did all the Hamburger Helper go?

(Garfielf lets out a big “brup”)

Jon: You're such a bad kitty! that's it! I've had it with you! that does it! I'm done! that's the last straw, Grarfileld!
